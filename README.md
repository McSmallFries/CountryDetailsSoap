# CountryDetailsSoap
 A web application that accesses a web service for country information using SOAP.
 This is a practice web application to demonstrate concepts that I've learned from
 CTEC3110 Secure Web App Development.
 ## Currently demonstrates the following:
 - SLIM PHP Microframework
 - Dependency injection.
 - Validation & Sanitisation.
 - Connecting to web service.
 - Making SOAP calls to web service.
 - Routes/routing.

## TODO:
 - Database functionality.
 - Integrate sessions.
